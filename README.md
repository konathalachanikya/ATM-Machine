# 🏧 ATM System in Python

This is a **console-based ATM simulation** developed using Python. It replicates essential banking operations including PIN verification, balance inquiry, deposit, and withdrawal.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 4-digit PIN authentication (`1234` by default)
- 💰 View current account balance
- ➕ Deposit money to the account
- ➖ Withdraw funds if sufficient balance exists
- 🧼 Clean, menu-driven interface in the terminal

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Standard libraries only)
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Input/Output handling

## 🧪 Sample Output
Enter your 4-digit PIN: 1234
Authentication successful.

1. Check Balance
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. Exit
Choose an option: 1
Your current balance is: ₹1000

## 💡 How It Works
- The program initializes with a starting balance (₹1000 by default).
- User is prompted to enter a 4-digit PIN.
- Upon successful authentication, a menu loop allows the user to:
- Check current balance
- Deposit or withdraw money
- Exit the program safely
🔒 Security Note
This is a basic simulation with hardcoded credentials and no encryption. Ideal for educational/demo purposes—not intended for real banking systems.

🧠 Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple users/accounts
- Persistent balance storage using files or databases
- Exception handling for invalid inputs
- GUI with Tkinter or web version using Flask
